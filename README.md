# Crop-Recomendation-System
This project uses machine learning to predict the most suitable crop for cultivation by analyzing key agricultural factors such as soil nutrients (N, P, K), temperature, humidity, pH level, and rainfall. It helps farmers make data-driven decisions to improve crop yield and ensure better agricultural productivity
